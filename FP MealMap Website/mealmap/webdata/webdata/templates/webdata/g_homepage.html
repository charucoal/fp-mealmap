                        Got surplus food or items near expiry? MealMap helps you quickly notify potential customers in your area. 
                        Post an alert with your offer, and our system automatically notifies users within increasing distance 
                        ranges if food remains unclaimed. This helps reduce waste, recover some costs, and bring new customers 
                        through your doors — all while supporting a greener community.
